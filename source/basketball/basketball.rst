History
-------

Basketball was created in **1891** in Springfield, Massachusetts by James Naismith. Naismith created it as a less injury prone sport when compared to basketball. The game was much different then what we see today. There were no circle rims, instead square peach baskets with the bottom cut out of them. You could not move with the ball even if you dribbled. There were originally only 13 rules:

1. The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.
2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.
3. A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.
4. The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.
5. No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.
6. A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.
7. If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.
8. A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.
9. When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The "thrower-in" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.
10. The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.
11. The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
12. The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.
13. The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.

This basic alternative to football has turned into one of the most popular sports in the entire world. Today basketball has all different types of of levels. Currently in the US there are AAU, middle school, and high school all on the same level. Next is the collegiate level. We have three different levels inside the colligate level (D1-D3). Next is the professional level. There are also different levels inside of the professional level. The absolute highest level of basketball played in the world today is the *NBA*. Players can also choose to play overseas for different countries professional leagues or in the *D-League* in the US. The *D-League* is right below the *NBA*. 


Basics
-------

The game of basketball is played between two teams. Each team has five players on the floor at a time. Games can be four quarters or two halves. Points are scored by shooting the ball into the hoop. Behind the three point line shots are worth three points. Inside of the three point line shots are worth two points. If you are fouled in the act of shooting you will shoot a freethrow. A freethrow is shot from the freethrow line with no defense. Each freethrow is worth one point. 

The five players on the court are typically playing a specific position. The tallest player on the team is usually the *5* or the center. The center is suppose to get lots of rebounds and defend the hoop. The shortest player on the team is usually the *1* or the point guard. The point guard is suppose to bring the ball up the court. They usually have very good dribbling skills and do a good job of setting up other players to score. The second smallest player on the team or the best shooter is usually the *2* or the shooting guard. The shooting guard is the best shooter on the team. Lots of a team scoring comes from its shooting guard. The second tallest player on the team is usually the *4* or the power forward. The power forward is not as tall as the center but is typically faster and a better scorer. What they lack in height they make up for in speed. They are good rebounders and defenders. Finally, we have the *3* or the small forward. The small forward is the hybrid of a center and point guard. They are typically taller, but can still handle the ball. They can score easily and play defense well.
