Swimming

History
-------

Swimming has been prevalent since the Stone Age, but did not officially become an organized sport until the 19th century. In earlier times, swimming was usually taught to cross rivers and lakes. It was often referenced in Greek mythology, and found in many cave paintings by Egyptians. The National Swimming Society of Great Britain was eventually formed in the 19th century, thus leading to the recognition of swimming as a competitive competition.

Swimming did not become an Olympic sport until 1896. When it was first introduced, the only strokes that were used were the freestyle and the breaststroke. Now, Olympic swimmers use the backstroke, freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly to compete with athletes around the world.
