History
-------

Football can be traced back to the mid-19th century. It is believed to be a spinoff of English rugby football. During this times two sports spun off of old rugby football. Football as known in the US and Futbol as known in the rest of the world. 

In America Walter Camp is known as the creator of football. The game of football gained its popularity through the college level. Fans loved supporting their teams in bowl games and rivalries within states. In **1932** the National Football League was created for players in college who excelled at football. Football could now be played professional. 


Basics
------

Football is played in four quarters. Each team is allowed 11 players on the field at a time. The offensive goal is to get the football in the end zone (six points). To do this the offense is given four plays to get passed a specific spot on the field. If they reach this spot they are given four more plays until they reach the end zone. If they do not reach this specific spot they turn the ball over to the other team. If the offense achieves this goal they must kick an extra point. This is where the kicker on the team kicks the football and tries to get it through the goal post. If successful, the kicking team is rewarded with one extra point. The offensive team can also choose to go for two. They must get the ball into the end zone a second time with only one play. If successful they are awarded two extra points. If a team cannot get the ball in the end zone they can attempted to kick it through the goal post from a much farther distance for three points instead of six. 

On offense, there is a QB (calls the plays and throws the ball), RB (runs the ball), WR (catches the ball), TE (blocks for the RB and catches passes from the QB), and a offensive line (blocks for the QB and RB).

On defense, there is a defensive line (get passed offensive line and tackle the QB or RB), DB (guard the WR and prevent them from catching a pass), LB (guard the RB and TE and prevent them from catching or running the ball), and SS/FS (The last line of defense against passes or runs).
