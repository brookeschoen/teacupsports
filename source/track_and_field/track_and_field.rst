Track and Field
================
History
-------
Track and  Field are among the oldest of all sports competitions because 
running, jumping, and throwing are basic and universal forms of human 
movements. The first recorded examples of track and field events are the 
Ancient Olympic Games in Olympia, Greece. The pentathlon was a major stride 
towards what we know about track and field today. Today, track and field 
is more popular, professional, and international. 

Basics
------
Track is split into three different types of categories. These categories 
are *track events*, *field events*, and *combined events*. The *track events* 
involve the athletes running a predetermined distance on the track. The 
distance can be from 60 meters to 10,000 meters. *Field events*, on the other 
hand, are divided into throwing events and jumping events. Jumping events 
include the long jump, triple jump, high jump, and pole vault. Throwing events 
include the shot put, discus throw, hammer throw, and the javelin. Combined 
events are, as you guessed it, a combination of track and field events. The 
three types of combined events are the pentathlon, heptathlon, and the 
decathlon.

relay at three consecutive Olympic Games to acheive this. He holds the fastest 
100m dash time of all-time with the time of 9.58 seconds. This happened on 
August 16, 2009 at the Olympic Games in Berlin.
