History
-------
Wrestling dates back to the times of Sumerians over 5,000 years ago. It 
became increasingly prominent to the Greeks. For the Greeks, wrestling 
was a science and art. It represented the most important training for 
young men. During the Ancient Olympic Games, wrestling was the last and most 
popular event in the Pentathlon after the discus, javelin, long jump, and the 
"foot race." This designated the winner of the Games.
