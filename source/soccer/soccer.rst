History
-------
The history of modern-day soccer was established in 1863 when the first laws 
were drawn up in London at the Freemason's Tavern. In 1872, the first official 
international soccer match was played between Scotland and England. It 
finished with a 0-0 draw. How boring. There was a uniform code that was 
introduced in 1883. The first soccer match that was played by teams outside 
of Great Britain was bewteen USA and Canada, which ended with Canada winning 
1-0. In 1900, soccer was played at the Olympic Games for the first time.
