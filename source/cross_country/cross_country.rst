History
-------

Cross Country originated in England during the early 1800’s. In the early years of this sport, runners would have to run much harsher courses than what is typical of today, and would often have to jump over hedges and cross streams during the race. Cross country started changing more towards today’s style around the late 1800’s, and started gaining attention in the United States. Many American track and field runners would run cross country to increase their stamina, but many others ran the sport to get into shape. The sport was added to the *Olympic Games* in the early 1900’s, but was quickly dropped because “it isn’t a traditional summer game, compared to Track & Field.” Now, many different cross country championships are held around the world that runners from any age group can compete in.
