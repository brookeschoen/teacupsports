Baseball
========

History
-------

Baseball was created in 1839 in Cooperstown, New York by Abner Doubleday. The first team to play baseball under the rules created by Doubleday was the New York Knickerbockers (which is currently a basketball team in the NBA). From there on Baseball grew to be America's past time and most popular sport over the next decade. 

Basics
------

Baseball teams today are made up of 25 players. Nine players can play defense at one time and one batter is allowed at one time. The nine defensive players are right field, center field, left field, third base, short stop, second base, first base, pitcher, and catcher. The pitcher throws the ball to the catcher to get the batter (offensive player) to swing and miss. When this happens, it is a strike. Three strikes and the batter is out. Three outs and the offense and defense trades places. The offense and defense trades places nine times or nine innings. The offense can score by swinging and hitting the ball into play. They must run to first base, second base, and third base before returning home. Once a player reaches home his team is rewarded a point. A base runner is only safe while touching a base. If the runner is not touching a base and is tagged by a defensive player with the ball that runner is than out. If the ball is hit out of the park it is considered a homerun and any offensive players on the bases can automatically go home and score. Each score is called a run.
